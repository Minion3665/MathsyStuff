Question 1:<br/>
  a) 28:42 = 14:21 = 2:3<br/>
  b) <br/>
  ```
  7 + 10 + 17 + 8 + 12 + 8 = 62
  6 + 14 + 15 + 8 + 21 + 10 = 74
  62:74 = 31:37
  ```
Question 2:<br/>
  Between 30 and 40 shares in the ratio 4:5<br/>
  `4 + 5 = 9`<br/>
  We need to find a multiple of 9 that is between 30 and 40<br/>
  `9 * 4 = 36`<br/>
  There were 36 sweets in the bag<br/>
Question 3:<br/>
  George bought stamps in groups of 5<br/>
  1 group costs him 1 first class stamp and 4 second class stamps<br/>
  `67 + 4(58) = 299`<br/>
  Each group costs him £2.99<br/>
  He buys 4 groups<br/>
  `299 * 4 = 1196`<br/>
  The stamps cost him £11.96<br/>
