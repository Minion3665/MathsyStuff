Question 1:
  a) 28:42 = 14:21 = 2:3
  b) 
  ```
  7 + 10 + 17 + 8 + 12 + 8 = 62
  6 + 14 + 15 + 8 + 21 + 10 = 74
  62:74 = 31:37
  ```
Question 2:
  Between 30 and 40 shares in the ratio 4:5
  `4 + 5 = 9`
  We need to find a multiple of 9 that is between 30 and 40
  `9 * 4 = 36`
  There were 36 sweets in the bag
Question 3:
  George bought stamps in groups of 5
  1 group costs him 1 first class stamp and 4 second class stamps
  `67 + 4(58) = 299`
  Each group costs him £2.99
  He buys 4 groups
  `299 * 4 = 1196`
  The stamps cost him £11.96
