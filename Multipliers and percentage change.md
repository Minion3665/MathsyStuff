# Multipliers
## To increase...
Multiply by 1 + the percentage, so to increase by 64%: (`1 + 0.64 = 1.64`) multiply by 1.64
## To decrease
Multiply by 1 - the percentage, so to decrease by 64%: (`1 - 0.64 = 0.36`) multiply by 0.36

# How to work out compound interest
Multipliers can also be used to work out compound interest easily. 
Say that you have a bank which gives you 1% interest each year and you would like to work out how much you have after 5 years...:<br/>
```
1 + 0.01 = 1.01 (to increase by 1%)

ASSUMING YOUR STARTING BALANCE WAS £5000

5000 * 1.01**5 = 5255.050251

YOU CAN JUST TAKE 5000 AND MULTIPLY IT BY YOUR MULTIPLIER TO THE POWER OF 5
```
If you're asked to just work out the interest, you can now subtract the original value<br/>
`5255.050251 - 5000 = 255.050251`

This same technique can be used to work out deprecation, such as if your car depricates in value by 20% each year:
```
So if your car was originally worth £10,000
1 - 0.20 = 0.8 (decrease by 20%)
10,000 * 0.8 = 8000
But what about after 5 years?
10,000 * 0.8**5 = 3276.80
```
Or to work out just the total amount lost...
`10,000 - 3276.80 = 6723.20`.
Better sell that car quickly if you don't want it
