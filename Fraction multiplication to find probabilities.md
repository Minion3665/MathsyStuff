# On any given day the probability that the bus is late is 1/3
What are the chances that...
## 1) The bus is late 2 days running
1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9

## 2) The bus is late 3 days running
1/9 * 1/3 = 1/27

## 3) In a working week, the bus is only late on Wednesday
(2/3)^4 * 1/3 = 16/243

## 4) The bus is not late on the first 3 days, but is on the other 2
(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^2 = 8/243

# I spin a coin 3 times...
## ... what's the probability that it will show heads then tails then heads
(1/2)^3 = 1/8

# On a given day, there is a 2/3 chance it will rain
## ... what's the probability it will rain 3 days in a row
(2/3)^3 = 8/27

# The probability a computer fails to start is 3/4
## What are the chances it works on Monday morning but not Tuesday or Wednesday morning
1/4 * (3/4)^2 = 9.64

# On a given day, there is a 1/10 chance it will rain...
## ... what's the probability it will not rain for 2 days, but then will rain once
(9/10)^2 * 1/10 = 81/1000

## ... what's the probability it will not rain for 1 day, but then will rain once, but then will be dry the next
(9/10)^2 * 1/10 = 81/1000

# A bag has 5 red and 3 green balls...
## ... what's the probability that 2 balls I draw are both red if I return the balls before redrawing
(5/8)^2 = 25/64

## ... or a red ball and then a green ball
5/8 * 3/8 = 15/64
