# On any given day the probability that the bus is late is 1/3
What are the chances that...
## 1) The bus is late 2 days running
1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9

## 2) The bus is late 3 days running
1/9 * 1/3 = 1/27

## 3) In a working week, the bus is only late on Wednesday
(2/3)^4 * 1/3 = 16/243

## 4) The bus is not late on the first 3 days, but is on the other 2
(2/3)^3 * (1/3)^2 = 8/243
